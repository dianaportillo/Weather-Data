## Fetching Live Weather Forecast

-- Overview
Given an open API website I will fetch their data for travelers to retrieve live weather for any specific city they search. This will give the user a 5-day forecast
and will allow them to see the temp, uv index, and winds for specfic day.

### The Challenge:
I have been given an open API website to render data for the users. I will retrieve a 5-day forecast for travelers and it will save past searches for them to 
reference back to. This API will run each time a city is searched and it will display live accurate data.

### User Story:
"AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly"

### Acceptance Criteria: 
"GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city"

## My Process:
Opening OpenWeatherApi.com looking for the correct documentation for 5-day forecast weather. Creating a specific API key for my website this will get called each time
the API is being called -- every time the user searches for a different city.
